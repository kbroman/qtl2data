## Data from Gray et al. (2015) on a mouse intercross, Gough Island &times; WSB

### Source

This is an F2 intercross between mice from Gough Island and WSB.
Two sibling pairs from two partially-inbred lines derived from Gough
Island Mice were crossed to WSB and pairs of F1s intermated.
The phenotype is body weight measured weekly from 1-16 weeks.
The phenotype data includes smoothed body weights and estimated first
derivatives of body weight.

The phenotypes include raw body weights weekly for 16 weeks, smoothed
body weights, and the first derivative of body weight (in g/week).

[Mouse Phenome Database](https://phenome.jax.org/projects/Payseur1).
